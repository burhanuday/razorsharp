## What this is not

Do not expect this plugin to generate 100% production ready code. To get the most out of this plugin:

- Ask designers to always use Blade components in Figma
- Ask designers to use Auto Layout in Figma
- Generate code per design section instead of the whole page

## Usage guide

For installation and usage instructions, please refer to the [usage guide](docs/usage.md).

## Contributing

Work in progress

- If you are developer, help by contributing to the codebase. Contributions can be bug fixes, support for new components, or documentation improvements.

- If you are a designer, help by pointing out bugs, suggesting improvements, or by creating a logo/cover image for Figma 😅.

## Reporting issues

Create a new GitHub issue or tag @Burhan on #design-system on the Razorpay Slack workspace.

Please include the following information:

- The component that you are trying to generate code for
- Link to the Figma file
- Screenshot of the Figma file and the generated code
